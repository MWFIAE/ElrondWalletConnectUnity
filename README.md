# Elrond Wallet Connect using Unity

Basic demo of how to connect a Maiar wallet and sign a transaction using Unity. Tested with Standalone and Android builds.
This project is still work in progress. It is public just because some members of the Elrond community asked for it.

This project uses the Wallet Connect Unity extension:

And the Elrond SDK .Net:

Please follow the documentations from above links for more details.

To test it, open the Login scene from the project.

The code is undocumentented for now and completely unpolished.
